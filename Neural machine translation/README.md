  NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION

This is a implementation of a encoder-decoder model for machine translation using Keras.
There are three main components the encoder, decoder and finally the attention mechanism which improves the model by upto 3 times.
(BLEU without attention: 5.34  ,  BLEU with attention : 15.24)
